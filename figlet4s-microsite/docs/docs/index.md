# Introduction

Figlet4s is a pure Scala, open source, library implementation of the ASCII-art program
[FIGlet](http://www.figlet.org/), with integrated fonts, minimal dependencies, extensive error
reporting and support for effects including Cats `IO`. It also includes direct support for Java.

But what is Figlet?

> FIGlet is a computer program that generates text banners, in a variety of typefaces, composed of
> letters made up of conglomerations of smaller ASCII characters (see ASCII art). The name derives
> from "Frank, Ian and Glenn's letters".
